The Datamodel of KCD is rather simple and reflects the following Use-Cases.

plantuml::{plantUmlDir}use_cases.puml[format=svg,alt="Use Cases"]

== Observation

An Observation is a concrete measurement and the root aggregate in this bounded-context.

An Observation contains some metadata in in most cases a simple value (element), some observations groups multiple elements together.

Parts of the metadata is necessary for the system to be able to generate reportings, other metadata is specific for the concrete observation type and will therefore stored in a map (extension).

To be able to handle values of different data-types, the Element is a generic structure which is then extended using a concrete data-type.
